   <h1> Science shows us a clear path to 2050 in which both nature and 10 billion people can thrive together.</h1>
   <h3>A few years ago The Nature Conservancy began a process of reassessing its<br> vision and goals for prioritizing its work around the globe. The resulting<br> statement called for a world where “nature and people thrive, and people act to<br> conserve nature for its own sake and its ability to fulfill and enrich our lives.”<br>

   <br> That sounds like a sweet future, but if you’re a scientist, like I am, you <br>immediately start to wonder what that statement means in a practical sense.<br> Could we actually get there? Is it even possible for people and nature to thrive<br> together?
    
   <br><br> Our leaders had the same question. In fact, when the vision statement was first<br> presented at a board meeting, our president leaned over and asked me if we had<br> the science to support it.<br><br>
    
    “No,” I said. “But we can try to figure it out.” <hr></h3>
    <h1 id="h1">“Smart” living</h1>
    <h3>The idea of “smart homes” is one that has really taken off in the<br> past decade. The concept builds on the idea of “smartphones” and other such devices, which are <br>accessible anywhere there is an internet connection. In the case of smart homes, a<br> person will have access to everything in their home (appliances, devices, utilities, <br>etc.) through Bluetooth and wireless internet.<br><br>

        In the future, this will extend to the point where the “Internet of Things” (IoT) becomes<br> a reality. This concept refers to the way in which the digital world and real world will<br> become intertwined like never before. On the one hand, this will be driven by the <br>trillions of devices, sensors, and geotags that connect countless points in the real<br> world to the internet.<hr></h3>
        <h1 id="h1">SUMMARY</h1>
        <h3>As the 21st century unfolds, the world will be forced to suffer through two major<br> opposing phenomena. Technological development will continue to accelerate, with<br> serious implications for the way we live, work, play, and even eat. At the same time,<br> climate change will be ramping up, causing severe disruptions to the very natural<br> systems humans are dependent on for their survival.<br><br>

            Luckily, there’s an upside to this mess of contradictions. While rising tides and<br> increased drought, storms, wildfires, etc., will be a humanitarian nightmare, they will<br> also pressure us to find solutions. And while the rapid advance of technology will be a <br>constant source of stress, it will also bring about innovation that addresses<br> environmental problems.<br><br>
            
            It will be a strange time, where the entire world will be caught between surviving and<br> thriving, scarcity and abundance, recession and growth. Nevertheless, the potential<br> for positive change is there and could lead to a whole new era of better living and<br> sustainability.
