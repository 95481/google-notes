        <h1>The Future of Robots and Robotics</h1>
        <br>
        <p>The future of robotics evokes both exciting and cautious undertones as employees <br>learn how to navigate a human-robot workforce.</p></div>

        <p >op culture is perhaps the main culprit for the public’s warped perception of the future of robotics. Although figures like C3PO in Star Wars, Data in Star Trek and the cyborg in The Terminator have given robotics some flashy mainstream appeal, they have also established narrow expectations for what robots could be and accomplish in the future.<br><br>

            “I’m never going to rule stuff out,” said Blake Hannaford, robotics professor at the University of Washington in Seattle. “But if you look back on science fiction from the ’50s and ’60s and compare it to today, it really missed the mark.”<br><br>
            
            For better or for worse, robots have defied human expectations. It’s unlikely that we’ll have to beware of Schwarzenegger-esque killer robots anytime soon, but even so, the future of robotics is sure to have surprises in store.</p>

        <h1>What Is Robotics?</h1>
        <hr>
        <P>First, let’s cover some of the basics. Robotics is the practice of designing and manufacturing robots, which perform physical tasks for humans and may possess some degree of autonomy. The field is interdisciplinary by nature, connecting to areas like engineering, computer science and artificial intelligence.

            While robots on the big screen often demonstrate human traits, the robotics field encompasses everything from humanoid machines to robotic arms that operate in an assembly line. Robots are already assisting humans in completing major surgeries, rescue operations and climate explorations. While robots fulfill wide-ranging roles, there are certain characteristics that link them under the same umbrella</P>

        <h1>What Are Robots?</h1><hr>
        <p>A robot is a machine that performs tasks typically completed by humans. Different robots come with varying degrees of automation, but each should be able to complete a certain set of tasks on its own. Here are a few basic traits common to all robots:<br><br>

           1. Robots display a physical form made of mechanical parts. <br>
           2. All robots require an electric current — whether from batteries or built-in circuitry — to power their movements and decisions.<br>
           3. Each robot is guided by programming software and rules that allow them to complete actions and sometimes make decisions on its own.  </p>
