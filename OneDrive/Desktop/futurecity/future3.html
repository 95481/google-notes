    <p >"Technology is advancing at an incredible speed. When we think of futuristic cars, we often think of the flying cars that<br> zoomed around in episodes of The Jetsons. But what does the future of cars look like now as we stand in 2024 and look ahead 25 years? "</p>

        By the time 2050 rolls around, most experts predict that gas powered cars will be receding into the past. While the exact number of electric cars on the road varies depending on who you talk to, it is generally agreed that as electric vehicles become more affordable and the infrastructure for it becomes more substantial, electric vehicles will take over. In Au<span id="color">gust 2022 Califor</span>nia enacted ACC II (Advanced Clean Cars), a vehicle sales standard that will require<span id="color"> all cars sold will have </span>zero emissions by 2035. This law is seen as a roadmap to zero emissions that oth<span id="color">er states are encouraged to </span> so that we can all live in a cleaner world. Seventeen other states–New York, Massachusetts, Vermont, Maine, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Washington, Oregon, New Jersey, Maryland, Delaware, Colorado, Minnesota, Nevada, Virginia, and New Mexico–have enacted legislation to help cut emissions, but only five of these states have embraced the strict requirements that California has in place.  If the remaining states enact stricter laws in the next few years, many believe that 75% of cars in 2050 will be electric. 

 

But while the switch to electric cars is being supercharged, it is not without its problems. There are significant disadvantages that may slow down the transition from gas to electric. The following issues will need to be addressed before an electric switch will make sense.

Electric vehicles require about 6x more critical materials than conventional cars.

The recycling industry is not efficient enough.

There is low compatibility with wind and solar.

New technology will require more energy to fuel it.

The infrastructure for charging stations needs a massive upgrade.

Current electric vehicles are expensive.
